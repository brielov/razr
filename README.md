### **Razr: A Cross-Platform Toolkit for Modern Web Development**

The `razr` namespace is a suite of lightweight, modular libraries designed to
simplify and enhance modern web development across all platforms. Built entirely
on **web standards** and free from external dependencies, `razr` empowers
developers to write consistent, secure, and efficient code that runs seamlessly
in **Node.js**, **Deno**, **Bun**, **Cloudflare Workers**, and **browsers**.

#### **What Razr Provides**

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Write once, run anywhere. `razr` leverages
  native web APIs to ensure compatibility across platforms without requiring
  polyfills or additional dependencies.
- **Web Standards First**: Built on top of modern web standards like the Web
  Crypto API, `FormData`, and others, ensuring future-proof and interoperable
  code.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Fully self-contained, with no reliance on external
  libraries, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any project.
- **TypeScript-First**: Designed with TypeScript for strong typing, better
  developer productivity, and enhanced code quality.
- **Security-Focused**: Prioritizes secure practices, such as constant-time
  comparisons, cryptographic best practices, and robust validation.

#### **Core Modules**

- **`@razr/schema`**: A fast and minimal schema validation library compliant
  with the `@standard-schema/spec`, perfect for validating data structures
  across platforms.
- **`@razr/formdata`**: Simplifies encoding and decoding of `FormData` for
  complex nested structures, ideal for handling form submissions in any
  environment.
- **`@razr/crypto`**: Provides secure password hashing, encryption, and key
  derivation using the Web Crypto API, ensuring consistent cryptographic
  operations everywhere.

#### **Why Razr?**

- **For Developers**: Focus on building features without worrying about
  platform-specific quirks or bloated dependencies.
- **For Teams**: Standardized, reusable tools that promote consistency,
  security, and maintainability across projects.
- **For Modern Web Apps**: Lightweight, performant, and designed to work with
  the latest web technologies, whether you're building for the browser, server,
  or edge.

#### **Cross-Platform, No Compromises**

`razr` is built to run everywhere:

- **Node.js**: Use `razr` in your backend applications with native support for
  modern APIs.
- **Deno & Bun**: Leverage `razr`'s web-standard approach in these modern
  runtime environments.
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Deploy `razr` to the edge with confidence, thanks to
  its lightweight and dependency-free design.
- **Browsers**: Use `razr` directly in the browser without additional tooling or
  polyfills.

Whether you're building a small project or a large-scale application, `razr`
empowers you to write clean, secure, and maintainable code that works seamlessly
across platforms.
